In machine learning workflows, the Pipeline class from Scikit-Learn is invaluable for streamlining data preprocessing and model training into a single, coherent sequence. A pipeline is essentially a sequence of data transformers that culminates with an optional final predictor. This structure enables seamless integration of preprocessing and predictive modeling, ensuring that the same data transformations applied during training are consistently applied to new data during prediction.In machine learning workflows, the Pipeline class from Scikit-Learn is invaluable for streamlining data preprocessing and model training into a single, coherent sequence.
